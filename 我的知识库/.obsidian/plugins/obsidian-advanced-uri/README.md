# Obsidian Advanced URI

A plugin for [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md)

## Overview

[Obsidian Advanced URI](https://github.com/Vinzent03/obsidian-advanced-uri) allows you to control many different features in Obsidian just by opening some URIs. Because they are just text and don't require any mouse clicks or keyboard inputs, they are perfect to automate your Obsidian workflow.

You can for example 
- [open files](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/navigation)
- [edit files](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/writing)
- [create files](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/writing)
- [open workspaces](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/navigation)
- [navigate to headings/blocks](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/navigation)
- [automated search and replace in a file](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri/actions/search_replace)

Please read the [documentation](https://vinzent03.github.io/obsidian-advanced-uri) for a detailed explanation.
